            <b> <font size ="6%"><center>APPLE CAKE</center></font></b>

            <p> This easy recipe for apple cake is a wonderful way to showcase fresh apples. Soft and tender with a stick-to-your-fork moist crumb and juicy apples in every bite, <br>
                this cake is delicious plain, topped with buttery brown sugar glaze, or even a quick dusting of confectioners’ sugar.<br><br>
                This apple cake is just the thing to make when you have some freshly picked apples from the orchard (or the grocery store),<br>
                 and you want a simple recipe for a crowd-pleasing dessert that’s ready to eat in the next couple of hours. And will be just as tasty served tomorrow!<br>
                The apple flavor is front and center, complemented by the background flavors provided by warm spices and sunny orange juice.<br><br>
                 If a beautiful fall day were a cake, it would taste like this
