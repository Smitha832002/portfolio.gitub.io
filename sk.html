            <p> A snack is a small portion of food generally eaten between meals.In general, a snack should not exceed 200 calories.<br>
                Snacks come in a variety of forms including packaged snack foods and other processed foods, as well as items made from fresh ingredients at home.<br>
                Snack foods are typically designed to be portable, quick, and satisfying. Processed snack foods, as one form of convenience food, are designed to be less perishable, more durable, and more portable than prepared foods. <br><br>
                They often contain substantial amounts of sweeteners, preservatives, and appealing ingredients such as chocolate, peanuts, and specially designed flavors (such as flavored potato chips).<br>
                 Aside from the use of additives, the viability of packaging so that food quality can be preserved without degradation is also important for commercialization<br><br>
