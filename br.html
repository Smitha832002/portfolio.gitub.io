            <p> It’s unclear where exactly biryani originated from and there are a few different theories as to who created the notable rice dish.<br>
                Many historians believe that biryani originated from Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals. <br><br>
                Biryani is my go-to dinner party dish. A one-pot meal of rice, meat, and aromatic spices, <br>
                it’s rich in flavor, grand in tradition, and elaborate enough to take center stage at holidays and celebrations, such as Eid or weddings.<br>
                Each bite is suffused with spice, roasted nuts, dried fruits, or caramelized onions—deep and layered in flavor.<br><br>
                Another version says that biryani was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India. <br>
                Both India and Pakistan have their own versions of the popular dish and they can vary from region to region.<br>
