            <p> Meals have become ingrained in each society as being natural and logical. What one society eats may seem extraordinary to another.<br>
                The same is true of what was eaten long ago in history, as food tastes, menu items, and meal periods have changed dramatically over time.<br> <br>
                During the Middle Ages, the main meal of the day, then called dinner, for almost everyone, took place late in the morning after several hours of work, when there was no need for artificial lighting.<br> 
                In the early to mid-17th century, the meal could be any time between late morning and mid-afternoon..<br>
